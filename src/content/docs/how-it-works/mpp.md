[MPP](https://mpp.dev) is an open payment protocol co-authored by Stripe and Tempo, now on the IETF standardization track. It extends HTTP 402 with standard authentication headers and supports multiple payment methods — stablecoins, fiat cards, Lightning, and more.

MPP is backwards-compatible with x402. Tollbooth's `mpp` settlement strategy lets you accept payments from both x402 and MPP clients through the same gateway.

## Why MPP

- **Multiple payment methods** — accept USDC stablecoins *and* Stripe card payments through one config
- **Standard headers** — uses `WWW-Authenticate` / `Authorization` / `Payment-Receipt` instead of custom headers
- **50+ integrations** — growing ecosystem of MPP-compatible agents and services
- **IETF track** — on the path to becoming an internet standard

## Configuration

```yaml
settlement:
  strategy: mpp
  methods:
    - type: tempo        # stablecoins via x402 facilitator
    - type: stripe       # fiat card payments via Stripe
      secretKey: "${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"
```

Each method in the `methods` array adds a payment option. Clients pick whichever method they support.

### Tempo method

Wraps the existing x402 facilitator for stablecoin payments. This is the same verify/settle flow as the default `facilitator` strategy, but advertised via MPP headers.

```yaml
settlement:
  strategy: mpp
  methods:
    - type: tempo
```

No additional config needed — it uses the same facilitator URL resolution (global `facilitator` field, per-route overrides, etc.).

### Stripe method

Accepts fiat card payments via Stripe's Shared Payment Tokens (SPT). Agents with a Stripe payment method can pay without crypto.

```yaml
settlement:
  strategy: mpp
  methods:
    - type: stripe
      secretKey: "${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"
```

The gateway creates a Stripe PaymentIntent for each challenge, and the client confirms it with their SPT credential.

## How it works

  |<─────────────────────────|                              |
```

### Header formats

**Challenge (402 response):**
```http
WWW-Authenticate: Payment id="abc", method="tempo", intent="charge",
    amount="0.01", currency="usd", decimals=6, description="GET /weather",
    request="<base64url-encoded-json>"
```

**Credential (request):**
```http
Authorization: Payment id="abc", payload="<base64url-encoded-json>"
```

**Receipt (success response):**
```http
Payment-Receipt: id="abc", receipt="<base64url-encoded-json>"
```

### Backward compatibility

When using the `mpp` strategy, tollbooth always returns **both** x402 and MPP headers:

- 402 responses include both `payment-required` and `WWW-Authenticate: Payment`
- Success responses include both `payment-response` and `Payment-Receipt`
- Incoming requests are accepted with either `payment-signature` (x402) or `Authorization: Payment` (MPP)

This means existing x402 clients continue to work unchanged.

## Comparison with other strategies

| Strategy | Payment methods | Headers | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `facilitator` | USDC stablecoins | x402 only | Simple x402 setups |
| `nanopayments` | USDC (batched) | x402 only | Sub-cent micropayments |
| **`mpp`** | **Stablecoins + fiat cards** | **x402 + MPP** | **Universal agent payments** |
| Custom | Anything | x402 only | Specialized logic |
